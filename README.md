# 🌐 LEAPR – Immersive Web Experience (2022 Archive)

> **LEAPR** was a strategy and design studio focused on immersive experiences, based in Argentina. Though the studio closed its doors in 2022, this interactive web experience was redeployed and preserved as part of my portfolio.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a scroll-based, 3D animated website built for LEAPR Studio. The experience allows visitors to navigate through the studio’s philosophy, featured projects, and design approach via smooth transitions and immersive visuals—all crafted in a fully WebGL-powered environment.

Originally deployed by the studio, the site is now hosted on my own server to ensure continued access and to showcase my work in creative development and interactive design.
